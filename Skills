Software architect:  soft skills needed
However, just as important as the technology-related skills are the "soft" skills that can drive performance and bring team members together for successful projects. 


Leadership - 
Overseeing the development of a project and coordinating teams of developers to meet design standards requires significant leadership. Software architects must be able to juggle the needs and demands of projects and teams.

Problem-solving & conflict resolution -
Managing and coordinating all of the elements that go into a successful application project requires strong problem-solving skills – both technical and human.

Communication -
Communication is a key ingredient in any leadership position. To get the best of teams, software architects must clearly explain the mission, deadlines, and expectations.

Coaching & inspiration -
If expectations aren’t being met, leaders have to coach and inspire team members to achieve.

Organization -
Since software architects set the roadmap for development, being organized is key. Often large-scale and intricate UML diagrams are necessary, which requires a systematic and organized way of thinking.

Prioritizing -
Software architects need to quickly prioritize tasks and juggle team members' assignments throughout a product’s development.

Detailed thinking -
In any development project, there are a significant number of details that must be managed correctly. This requires extreme attention to detail to make sure the project code meets objectives. 

Creative thinking -
The software architect has to move teams forward to accomplish a build regardless of the obstacles. This takes the ability to think creatively to find alternate solutions or creative ways to solve problems.
