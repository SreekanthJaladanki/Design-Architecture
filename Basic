Difference Between "Software Architecture & Software Design"

The architect is concerned with the ‘big picture’ questions of what the project is, how it will look, what its function is, and so on, whereas the designer/engineer is concerned with how to make the architect’s ideas work. The software architecture is all done before any of the actual coding begins.

Software architecture involves understanding and organising a system, all of its components, their interactions, the environment in which they operate, and the core principles which will be used to design the software.

Software design is all about how the software architecture can be implemented into the overall system. This involves:
  -Coding
  -Using specific design patterns
  -Choosing classes, interfaces, functions and responsibilities
  -Working with specific components and modules
